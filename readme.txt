A simple plugin that ads animation on scroll (AOS) to Gutenberg blocks.

== Description ==

After years of doing the manual work, I've come up with a plugin that I have been re-using in my own web projects for some time now.  

This plugin takes great work by [@michalsnik](https://github.com/michalsnik) with his Animate on [Scroll Library (AOS)](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos/tree/v2) and adds it to the most common Gutenberg blocks.

This is a open library with simple fields so that you can adjust the animations to every possible option. Animation controls are added to:

* group
* columns
* cover
* image
* media-text
* gallery
* embed
* paragraph
* heading

Don't see the block you need or programmed a custom block?  Just put it inside a group to give you full animation control.
